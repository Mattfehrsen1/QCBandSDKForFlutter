# Multi-Day Heart Rate Implementation Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

**Objective**: Implement a device timestamp-driven multi-day heart rate data collection system that automatically detects and segments data spanning multiple days using real device timestamps from ALL packets.

**Current State**: Single-day HR collection with real timestamp extraction from packet 1 only
**Target State**: Multi-day HR collection with automatic day detection and segmentation using timestamps from all packets

---

## üîç Analysis Summary

### Current Implementation Strengths
‚úÖ **Real timestamp extraction from packet 1** (bytes 2-5, little-endian)  
‚úÖ **Multi-packet assembly system** with duplicate prevention  
‚úÖ **Data validation and gap detection**  
‚úÖ **288 precise readings per day** (5-minute intervals)  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive packet structure analysis**  

### Current Limitations
‚ùå **Only packet 1 timestamps extracted** - other packets may contain timing info  
‚ùå **Single-day assumption** - no multi-day boundary detection  
‚ùå **Client-side time calculations** - should use device timestamps exclusively  
‚ùå **No automatic day segmentation** - data not organized by actual dates  

### Key Insight
**Each packet contains timestamp information** - we need to extract and analyze timing data from ALL packets, not just packet 1, to enable automatic multi-day detection and segmentation.

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. PacketTimestampInfo Class
```dart
class PacketTimestampInfo {
  final DateTime? absoluteTimestamp;  // From packet 1: absolute start time
  final int? relativeOffset;          // From other packets: time offset
  final int packetIndex;
  final List<int> rawTimestampBytes;
  final bool isStartPacket;
}
```

#### 2. MultiDayDataCollector Class
```dart
class MultiDayDataCollector {
  Map<String, Map<String, int>> daySegmentedData = {}; // "2025-01-22" -> HR data
  Map<String, PacketTimestampInfo> dayStartTimestamps = {};
  String? currentProcessingDate;
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Parsing System
- Extract timestamps from ALL packets
- Calculate real reading times using device timestamps
- Automatically detect day boundaries
- Segment data by actual dates
