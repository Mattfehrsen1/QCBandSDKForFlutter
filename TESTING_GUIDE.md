# QC Band SDK - Workout Data Parsing Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide covers testing the improved workout data parsing functionality in the QC Band SDK for Flutter.

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Environment Verification
```bash
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter analyze  # Should show only style warnings, no errors
```

### 2. Hardware Requirements
- QC Band fitness device with BLE capability
- Android/iOS device for testing
- Proper BLE permissions configured

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Workout Flow Testing

#### Test 1.1: Start Workout
**Steps:**
1. Open the app and connect to QC Band
2. Tap "Start Workout" button
3. Select workout type from dialog (Walking, Running, etc.)
4. Verify workout starts on device

**Expected Results:**
- Workout type selection dialog appears with all sport types
- Green "ACTIVE" status shows in workout display
- Live timer starts counting
- Console shows: "Workout started (Type: [Selected Sport])"

#### Test 1.2: Receive Workout Data
**Steps:**
1. Continue from Test 1.1
2. Perform workout activity (walk, run, etc.)
3. Monitor app for incoming data packets

**Expected Results:**
- Workout metrics card populates with real data
- Distance, calories, steps update appropriately
- Speed calculation shows reasonable values
- Console shows: "Successfully parsed sport data: Type=X, Duration=Xs..."

#### Test 1.3: End Workout
**Steps:**
1. Continue from Test 1.2
2. Tap "End Workout" button
3. Verify workout ends on device

**Expected Results:**
- Orange "COMPLETED" status shows
- Timer stops
- Final workout data remains displayed
- Console shows: "Workout ended"

### 2. Error Handling Testing

#### Test 2.1: Malformed Data Packets
**Steps:**
1. Connect to device
2. Monitor console for any "Error:" or "Warning:" messages
3. Look for automatic data correction messages

**Expected Results:**
- App doesn't crash on invalid data
- Validation warnings appear in console
- Data gets corrected automatically when possible
- User-friendly error messages shown

#### Test 2.2: Connection Interruption
**Steps:**
1. Start a workout
2. Turn off device Bluetooth or move out of range
3. Reconnect after 10-15 seconds

**Expected Results:**
- App handles disconnection gracefully
- Workout state preserved during reconnection
- No crashes or data corruption

### 3. Type Safety Testing

#### Test 3.1: Sport Type Validation
**Steps:**
1. Start workouts with different sport types
2. Verify each type displays correctly
3. Check console for sport type parsing logs

**Expected Results:**
- All sport types (Walking, Running, Cycling, etc.) work
- Display names match selected types
- SportType enum provides type safety

#### Test 3.2: Command ID Routing
**Steps:**
1. Monitor console during various BLE operations
2. Look for command ID identification logs

**Expected Results:**
- Console shows: "Received sport data packet: Sport Data"
- Console shows: "Received workout status packet: Workout Status Start"
- BleCommandId enum correctly identifies commands

### 4. UI/UX Testing

#### Test 4.1: Workout Display Widget
**Steps:**
1. Start a workout
2. Verify all UI elements appear correctly
3. Check responsiveness during data updates

**Expected Results:**
- Workout metrics grid displays properly
- Real-time timer updates smoothly
- Status indicators (ACTIVE/COMPLETED) work
- Metric cards show appropriate icons and colors

#### Test 4.2: Loading States
**Steps:**
1. Start workout
2. Observe loading state before data arrives
3. Verify smooth transition to data display

**Expected Results:**
- "Waiting for workout data..." message appears
- Circular progress indicator shows
- Smooth transition when data arrives

### 5. Data Validation Testing

#### Test 5.1: Boundary Values
**Steps:**
1. Perform very short workouts (< 10 seconds)
2. Perform longer workouts (> 1 hour)
3. Monitor data validation

**Expected Results:**
- Short workouts handled correctly
- Long duration formatting works (hours/minutes/seconds)
- No negative values in display
- Reasonable speed calculations

#### Test 5.2: Edge Cases
**Steps:**
1. Start/stop workout immediately
2. Start multiple workouts quickly
3. Test with different devices/configurations

**Expected Results:**
- No crashes or undefined behavior
- Proper cleanup of previous workout sessions
- Consistent behavior across devices

## Debugging Tools

### Console Logging
Monitor console for these key messages:
```
✅ "Successfully parsed sport data: Type=X, Duration=Xs..."
✅ "Workout started (Type: Running)"
✅ "Received sport data packet: Sport Data"
⚠️ "Warning: Invalid duration value: -1, setting to 0"
❌ "Error: Failed to parse workout data - null result"
```

### Validation Checks
The app includes automatic validation for:
- Negative duration, distance, calories, steps
- Invalid date/time values
- Packet length validation
- Sport type range checking

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No workout data received
**Solutions:**
1. Verify BLE connection is active
2. Check device compatibility
3. Ensure workout is actually started on device
4. Monitor console for command ID routing issues

### Issue: Incorrect metrics displayed
**Solutions:**
1. Check unit conversions (meters → km)
2. Verify calculation logic for speed/pace
3. Look for data validation warnings in console

### Issue: App crashes on data parsing
**Solutions:**
1. Update to latest SDK version with improved validation
2. Check for try-catch blocks around parsing code
3. Enable verbose logging for debugging

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- **Workout start response**: < 2 seconds
- **Data parsing time**: < 100ms per packet
- **UI update lag**: < 50ms
- **Memory usage**: Stable during long workouts

### Monitoring
Use Flutter DevTools to monitor:
- Widget rebuild frequency
