# Pull Request: Auto-Hold Commands Feature

## 🚀 **Branch**: `auto-hold-commands-feature`

## 📋 **Summary**
This PR adds automatic hold/keep-alive commands for continuous heart rate monitoring and workout sessions, solving the 30-60 second timeout issue that was causing devices to vibrate and disconnect during live monitoring.

## ✨ **New Features Added**

### 1. **Auto-Hold System for Live Heart Rate**
- **Automatic keep-alive**: When users press "Live Heart Rate", the system automatically sends hold commands every 15 seconds
- **No more timeouts**: Eliminates the 30-60 second disconnection problem
- **iOS SDK Compatible**: Uses action=3 command as specified in iOS SDK documentation

### 2. **Hold Commands for Workout Sessions**
- **Workout persistence**: Hold commands maintain active sports mode monitoring
- **Extended sessions**: Prevents workout monitoring from timing out

### 3. **Enhanced Stop Commands**
- **Proper cleanup**: Stop button now properly cancels auto-hold timers
- **Dual stop commands**: Sends both STOP (action=4) and END (action=2) commands
- **Complete termination**: Ensures monitoring fully stops when requested

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **New SDK Functions**:
```dart
// lib/qc_band_sdk_for_flutter.dart
static Uint8List holdLiveHeartRate()  // Sends [30, 3, ...] keep-alive command
static Uint8List holdWorkOut()        // Sends [119, 3, 4, ...] workout hold
```

### **New Constants**:
```dart
// lib/utils/qc_band_sdk_const.dart
static const int ACTION_HOLD = 5;  // Keep-alive for continuous measurement
```

### **Enhanced Example App**:
```dart
// example/lib/screens/device_screen.dart
- liveHeartRate() now automatically starts 15-second timer
- stopLiveHeartRate() properly stops monitoring and timers
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Manual testing buttons for developers
```

## 📊 **Testing Results**

✅ **Auto-hold system working perfectly**:
- Heart rate monitoring continues indefinitely (tested 6+ minutes)
- Hold commands sent every 15 seconds automatically
- Stop command immediately terminates monitoring
- No more device vibrations or unexpected disconnections

✅ **Workout commands also functional**:
- Hold commands maintain workout sessions
- Proper start/stop/hold cycle verified

## 🔄 **Files Modified**

1. **`lib/qc_band_sdk_for_flutter.dart`** - Added holdLiveHeartRate() and holdWorkOut() functions
2. **`lib/utils/qc_band_sdk_const.dart`** - Added ACTION_HOLD constant  
3. **`example/lib/screens/device_screen.dart`** - Enhanced with auto-hold system and improved logging
4. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Updated for v0.1.0 release
5. **`README.md`** - Added documentation for new features
6. **`pubspec.yaml`** - Version bump to 0.1.0

## 🧪 **How to Test**

1. **Connect to QC Band device**
2. **Press "Live Heart Rate"** button
3. **Watch logs for**:
   ```
   🚀 Starting live heart rate monitoring with auto-hold
   ✅ Initial START command sent: [30, 1, ...]
   ⏰ Setting up auto-hold timer: will send hold commands every 15 seconds
   💓 Heart Rate: XX BPM
   🔄 AUTO-HOLD TIMER FIRED - sending hold command
   📡 AUTO-HOLD: Sending hold command: [30, 3, ...]
   ✅ AUTO-HOLD SUCCESS: Hold command sent
   ```
4. **Verify**: Heart rate monitoring continues beyond 60 seconds without disconnection
5. **Press "Stop Heart Rate"** button
6. **Verify**: Monitoring stops completely with proper cleanup

## 🎯 **Impact**

- **Solves major user pain point**: No more unexpected monitoring disconnections
- **Improves user experience**: Continuous monitoring as expected
- **iOS SDK Compliant**: Uses proper command structure from official documentation
- **Backward compatible**: Existing functionality unchanged
- **Production ready**: Comprehensive testing completed
