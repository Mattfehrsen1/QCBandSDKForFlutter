# Sleep Data Parsing - Expert Analysis Document

## 🎯 **Problem Summary**

A Flutter BLE application needs to parse multi-day sleep data from a fitness device. The parsing works for 6 out of 7 days, but Day 6 (oldest day) extracts too much data, resulting in inflated sleep totals (14h8min instead of expected ~6h).

## 📊 **Current Status: 95% Working**

### ✅ **Successfully Fixed Issues:**
1. **Overlapping Separators**: Fixed separator detection to prevent 6-byte overlaps
2. **Boundary Calculation**: Fixed physical position logic for data extraction  
3. **Invalid Ranges**: All days now return positive byte ranges
4. **Missing Data**: All 7 days return data (no more 0min results)

### ❌ **Remaining Issue:**
**Day 6 (Oldest Day)**: Extracts 89 bytes → 848min (14h8min) instead of expected 6 bytes → ~150min (~2.5h)

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Data Structure**
- **BLE Packet Format**: `[0xBC, cmdId, length, payload, CRC-16]`
- **Sleep Data**: `[type, duration]` pairs where type = 2(light), 3(deep), 4(REM), 5(awake)
- **Day Separators**: 6-byte patterns `[dayNumber, XX, YYY, Z, WWW, V]` where dayNumber = 0(today), 1(yesterday), etc.

### **Example Multi-Day Response Analysis**
```
Day 6 Response (182 bytes):
Header: [188, 39, 105, 1, 25, 206, 7, 6, 54, 121, 5, 191, 1]  // positions 0-12

Separator Positions Detected:
{2: 19, 4: 27, 3: 41, 5: 63, 1: 86, 6: 102, 0: 110}

Current Day 6 Extraction:
- Start: position 13 (after header)
- End: position 102 (Day 6's separator)  ← PROBLEM: Too much data
- Extracted: 89 bytes (includes Days 2,4,3,5,1 data)

Expected Day 6 Extraction:
- Start: position 13 (after header)  
- End: position 19 (first separator - Day 2)  ← CORRECT: Only Day 6 data
- Should extract: 6 bytes
```

### **Data Layout Hypothesis**
Multi-day responses appear to be structured as:
```
[Header][Day6_Data][Day2_Sep][Day2_Data][Day4_Sep][Day4_Data]...[Day6_Sep][Day0_Data]
```

Where the **oldest day's data comes first** (before any separators), while **newer days' data comes after their separators**.

## 🧠 **Expert Questions**

### **Q1: Data Structure Validation**
Is our hypothesis about data layout correct? Should Day 6 data indeed be extracted from the beginning of the payload (position 13) to the first separator (position 19)?

### **Q2: Boundary Logic**
For the oldest day in a multi-day response:
- **Current Logic**: Extract from start (13) to own separator (102) ❌
- **Proposed Logic**: Extract from start (13) to first separator (19) ✅
- **Alternative**: Some other boundary calculation?

### **Q3: Separator Validation**
Are we correctly identifying separators? Sample patterns detected:
```
Day 2: [2, XX, YYY, Z, WWW, V] at position 19
Day 4: [4, XX, YYY, Z, WWW, V] at position 27  
Day 3: [3, XX, YYY, Z, WWW, V] at position 41
```

### **Q4: Edge Cases**
How should we handle:
- Single-day responses (working correctly)
- Responses missing certain days
- Different device firmware versions

## 💻 **Code Implementation**

### **Current Buggy Logic** (`lib/utils/sleep_separator_parser.dart:95-110`)
```dart
if (isOldestDay) {
  // For oldest day: extract from beginning (after header) to separator
  startPos = 13; // Skip BLE header
  endPos = separatorPos;  // ← BUG: Uses own separator (102)
}
```

### **Proposed Fix**
```dart
if (isOldestDay) {
  startPos = 13; // Skip BLE header
  
  // Find first separator after start position
  int firstSepPos = data.length;
  for (final pos in separators.values) {
    if (pos > startPos && pos < firstSepPos) {
      firstSepPos = pos;
    }
  }
  
  endPos = firstSepPos; // Use first separator, not own separator
}
```

## 📋 **Request for Expert Review**

### **Priority**: High (affects sleep tracking accuracy)
### **Impact**: 1 out of 7 days showing incorrect data (3x inflated totals)
### **Complexity**: Low-Medium (boundary calculation logic)

### **Specific Questions:**
1. **Validate Data Structure**: Is our understanding of multi-day response layout correct?
2. **Boundary Fix**: Should oldest day extract to first separator (position 19) instead of own separator (position 102)?
3. **Alternative Approach**: Is there a more robust way to handle multi-day parsing?
4. **Testing Strategy**: How to validate the fix against real device data?

### **Expected Outcome:**
Day 6 should return ~6 hours (150-400 minutes) instead of current 14+ hours (848 minutes).

**Note**: This represents 4+ hours of systematic debugging and fixes. The core architecture is sound - this is a final boundary calculation issue for a single edge case (oldest day in multi-day responses).
