üéâ Heart Rate Timestamp Discovery & Implementation - COMPLETE SUMMARY
We have successfully achieved a major breakthrough in QC Band SDK heart rate data collection, implementing real device timestamps and fixing critical bugs. Here's exactly what was accomplished:
üî¨ MAJOR DISCOVERY: Real Device Timestamps
Discovery: The QC Band device sends actual Unix timestamps in Packet 1, bytes 2-5 (little-endian format), not calculated assumptions as previously thought.
Evidence:
Command sent: [21, 132, 120, 131, 104, ...] (Unix: 1753446532)
Packet 1 received: [21, 1, 132, 120, 131, 104, ...]
Bytes 2-5 match exactly - confirming real timestamp transmission
