### BLE Command Documentation for Alarm Management Extracted from Decompiled APK

Based on the provided code snippets, here is a complete documentation of the commands sent from the phone to the BLE device for managing alarms.

#### 1. Get Alarms Command

This command is used to request the alarm settings for a specific alarm index from the device.

* **Purpose**: To retrieve the configuration of a single alarm.
* **Command Structure**: A list of two bytes.
* **Byte Breakdown**:
    * **Byte 0 (Command ID)**: `36` (Hex `0x24`) - Corresponds to `Constants.CMD_GET_ALARM_CLOCK`.
    * **Byte 1 (Alarm Index)**: A value from `0` to `2`, representing the index of the alarm.

* **Example**: To get the alarm at index 1, the command would be `[36, 1]`.

#### 2. Set/Edit Alarms Command

This command is used to create a new alarm or modify an existing one on the device.

* **Purpose**: To send a new or updated alarm configuration to the device.
* **Command Structure**: A list of six bytes.
* **Byte Breakdown**:
    * **Byte 0 (Command ID)**: `35` (Hex `0x23`) - Corresponds to `Constants.CMD_SET_ALARM_CLOCK`.
    * **Byte 1 (Alarm Index)**: An integer from `0` to `2` specifying which alarm to set.
    * **Byte 2 (Enable/Disable)**: `1` for an enabled alarm, `0` for a disabled alarm.
    * **Byte 3 (Hour)**: An integer representing the hour of the alarm (0-23).
    * **Byte 4 (Minute)**: An integer representing the minute of the alarm (0-59).
    * **Byte 5 (Week Mask)**: A byte used as a bitmask to specify the days of the week the alarm is active.
        * Each bit corresponds to a day of the week, with the least significant bit (LSB) often representing Sunday.
        * For example:
            * `00000001` (binary) = `1` (decimal) -> Sunday
            * `00000010` (binary) = `2` (decimal) -> Monday
            * `01111110` (binary) = `126` (decimal) -> Monday to Friday

* **Example**: To set an enabled alarm at 7:30 AM for index 0, active on Monday through Friday, the command might look like `[35, 0, 1, 7, 30, 62]`. (Here, 62 is the decimal value for binary `00111110` which represents Monday to Friday assuming a different week mapping)

#### 3. Delete Alarms Command

This command is used to delete an alarm from the device.

* **Purpose**: To remove a specific alarm setting.
* **Command Structure**: A list of three bytes.
* **Byte Breakdown**:
    * **Byte 0 (Command ID)**: `16` (Hex `0x10`) - Corresponds to `Constants.CMD_SIMPLE_KEY`.
    * **Byte 1 (Key)**: `3` - This key specifically indicates an "Alarm" action.
    * **Byte 2 (Value)**: `2` - This value indicates the "delete" action for the alarm.

* **Example**: The command to delete an alarm is a fixed sequence `[16, 3, 2]`.
