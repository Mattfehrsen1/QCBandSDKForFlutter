# AI Agent Handoff - Sleep Data Parsing Project

## 🎯 **Current Mission**

We are fixing a **sleep data parsing accuracy issue** in a Flutter BLE application. The system currently achieves 95% technical success but has **significant accuracy problems** where extracted sleep totals don't match real user data for Days 2-6.

## 📊 **Problem Summary**

**What Works Perfect:**
- Days 0 & 1: Return exactly 8h3min (matches expected data perfectly) ✅
- All 7 days return data (no more 0min errors) ✅  
- No crashes or invalid data ranges ✅

**What's Broken:**
- Days 2-6: Significant discrepancies between extracted vs real sleep data
- Day 2: Gets 3h16min instead of expected 9h58min (67% too low)
- Day 3: Gets 4h32min instead of expected 8h37min (47% too low)  
- Day 4: Gets 0h51min instead of expected 6h34min (87% too low)
- Day 5: Gets 11h17min instead of expected 6h3min (86% too high)
- Day 6: Gets 0h57min instead of expected 8h6min (88% too low)

## 🔍 **Root Cause Discovery**

**SMOKING GUN**: Our separator detection algorithm was **100% wrong**!

**What We Were Detecting (FALSE):**
- `[2, 9, 3, 38, 4, 4]` - This is actually sleep data: Light sleep 9min, Deep sleep 38min, REM 4min
- `[3, 38, 4, 4, 5, 9]` - More sleep data, not separators

**What REAL Separators Look Like (from CSV analysis):**
- `[2, 36, 69, 0, 161, 1]`  
- `[3, 32, 219, 0, 191, 1]`
- `[4, 36, 120, 5, 136, 1]`
- Pattern: `[dayNumber, 20-42, ANY, 0|5, ANY, 0|1]`

## 📁 **Critical Reference Files**

### **1. COMPLETE_SLEEP_DATA_ANALYSIS.md** 
- **400+ line expert analysis document** with all technical details
- Contains real vs current results comparison tables
- Raw data analysis from working vs broken cases  
- Complete CSV data from user's July 2024 analysis
- Debug output showing exactly what our algorithm detects vs reality
- **MOST IMPORTANT**: Shows the "smoking gun" evidence of algorithm detecting sleep data as separators

### **2. lib/utils/sleep_separator_parser.dart**
- **Current implementation** with the corrected algorithm
- We JUST implemented a new REAL separator detection algorithm based on pattern `[dayNumber, 20-42, ANY, 0|5, ANY, 0|1]`
- Added fallback mechanism that tries old approach if REAL separators not found
- Has extensive debug logging to show what separators are found/rejected

### **3. CSV Data (Shahryar sleep data/ folder)**
- Contains actual BLE response data from July 2024
- Shows REAL separator patterns that work correctly
- User's manual analysis identifying correct separator positions

## 🚨 **Latest Status - JUST IMPLEMENTED**

**What We Just Did:**
1. **Implemented REAL separator algorithm** that validates pattern `[dayNumber, 20-42, ANY, 0|5, ANY, 0|1]`
2. **Added hybrid fallback** - tries REAL separators first, falls back to old method for compatibility
3. **Enhanced debug logging** to show exactly why candidates are rejected

**What Happened in Latest Test:**
- User ran the test but said "Don't think it worked properly"
- Logs were too long to share in conversation
- **SUSPECTED ISSUE**: Current device data format may be different from July 2024 CSV data
- Algorithm probably found NO REAL separators and fell back to old approach

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Priority 1: Analyze Current Test Results**
You need to see the actual log output to understand:
1. **Did new algorithm find any REAL separators?** (Look for ✅ REAL separator validated messages)
2. **What candidates were rejected and why?** (Look for ❌ Rejected candidate messages with reasons)
3. **Did fallback algorithm activate?** (Look for 🔄 Fallback messages)
4. **What were the final accuracy results?** (Compare Day 2-6 totals vs expected)

### **Priority 2: Device Data Format Investigation**
**Critical Question**: Why don't current BLE responses contain the same separator patterns as July 2024 CSV?

**Possible Causes:**
- Different device model/firmware version
- Protocol changes since July 2024  
- Device configuration differences
- Data structure evolution

### **Priority 3: Solution Strategy**
**If REAL separators found**: Great! Check if accuracy improved
**If NO REAL separators found**: Need to decide:
- Option A: Improve fallback algorithm to be more accurate
- Option B: Abandon separator approach entirely (parse each as single-day)
- Option C: Investigate why current data format differs from CSV

## 🔧 **Technical Context**

**Sleep Data Format**: `[type, duration]` pairs where:
- `[2, XX]` = Light sleep, XX minutes  
- `[3, YY]` = Deep sleep, YY minutes
- `[4, ZZ]` = REM sleep, ZZ minutes
- `[5, WW]` = Awake, WW minutes

**BLE Protocol**: 
- Header: `[188, 39, length, 0, ...]`
- Days 0 & 1: Single-day responses (59 bytes) - work perfectly
- Days 2-6: Multi-day responses (109-182 bytes) - accuracy issues

**Current Algorithm Flow**:
1. Send BLE command for specific day (0-6)
2. Receive response (59-182 bytes)  
3. If >80 bytes → multi-day, try separator detection
4. Extract day-specific data using separator boundaries
5. Parse with legacy SleepParser

## 💡 **Key Insights for Next Agent**

1. **The infrastructure works perfectly** - Days 0 & 1 prove parsing logic is correct
2. **The separator detection was fundamentally flawed** - detecting sleep data instead of real separators  
3. **We have ground truth data** - CSV shows what REAL separators should look like
4. **Current device may use different format** - explaining why new algorithm didn't work
5. **Fallback mechanism provides safety net** - worst case, same accuracy as before

## 📋 **Success Criteria**

**Target Results** (what we need to achieve):
- Day 2: ~598min instead of 196min  
- Day 3: ~517min instead of 272min
- Day 4: ~394min instead of 51min
- Day 5: ~363min instead of 677min  
- Day 6: ~486min instead of 57min

**While maintaining**:
- Day 0: 483min ✅ (currently perfect)
- Day 1: 483min ✅ (currently perfect)

## 🚀 **Immediate Action Required**

**Ask user for the actual log output** from latest test to see:
1. Separator detection results  
2. Rejection reasons for candidates
3. Whether fallback activated
4. Final accuracy numbers

Then decide next steps based on what the logs reveal about current device data format vs expected CSV patterns.

The solution is close - we just need to understand why current device data differs from the CSV patterns and adapt accordingly!
